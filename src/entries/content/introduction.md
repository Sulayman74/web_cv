I am currently a trainee in web and apps development at Digifab - Annemasse. During this year, I will be learning all the skills required to integrate a web developer team.
I will be able ton handle front-end and back-end tasks.

I will graduate with a Bachelor degree at the end of this training session of 11 months,
with a 2 months intership from January to March.
The school is certified by "Grande école du numérique".
